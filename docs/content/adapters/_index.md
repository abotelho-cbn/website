Data Adapters is a Choria technology that exists to convert data from the highly concurrent broadcast medium of Choria into formats more suitable to processing using technologies like Stream Processing.

![Adapters Overview](../adapters-overview.png)

The use cases for this include:

 * Receiving data from large amounts of nodes and processing out of band
 * Receiving telemetry such as temperature and humidity from IoT devices that embed Choria Server
 * Creating secure setups where requestors will not be able to view replies - they go into something like Elastic Search
 * Scaling asynchronous services by storing replies to requests in a less real time medium

At present only NATS Streaming and NATS JetStream is supported, this feature is under active development

Data adapters are hosted inside the Choria Brokers much the same way that Network Brokers and Federation Brokers can live in the same binary.
