We have a number of releases today that will be the start of big changes in our modules. These releases will hopefully have a minor impact on users, but the next release or two will require some Hiera changes, so it's worth keeping an eye on these. **For the next while testing in your labs and dev environments is essential**.

This is the beginning of a big push to once again simplify our deployment story.  Choria started as a trivial way to install MCollective but things have changed quite a lot since then and unfortunately entropy has had its effect on our modules.

In addition to these changes we also have some pretty amazing additions to the Choria Servers.

Read on for the background and details of what's to come.

Special thanks to Tim Meusel, Vincent Janelle, Vladislav Kuspits and Romain Tarti√®re for their contributions in this release.

## WARNING

I'll start with a warning, this is a big change. Many files will be deleted from the lib dirs, many new files will be made. We're changing a default that will remove many unmanaged files.

You have to test this release in pre-release or staging, we did our best, we found many upgrade issues in development but we cannot anciticpate every possible scenario.  Please test thoroughly.

## Background

It's worth a quick look back at how we got here. Initially Choria was a way to install MCollective easily for Puppet 4 users. To do that we wrote some Ruby plugins for the Puppet Inc MCollective system as delivered in `puppet-agent`.

We had a `mcollective` module to handle the configuration aspects of MCollective and a `mcollective_choria` one to install our plugins into it. 

This was easy to use and easy to understand what's what. We had wide user adoption, lots of systems managed by these plugins and lots of code, hiera data and more relying on them.

Since then Puppet Inc deprecated their shipped MCollective, donated the old code back to me, and I wrote a new Go based server to replace `mcollectived`. To support this new server, its broker and various other components a `choria` module was created.

Today there's an unfortunate mix of mcollective and choria modules - with sometimes even contradicting and overlapping configuration options. For some things to work both modules need to be configured with the same settings.

We also have configuration and libraries in the old Puppetlabs locations, it would be better to move into our own locations.

This is not acceptable, in the end attempting to keep users systems working without big changes in their deployments gave us a confusing and difficult to use system.

## The way forward

We will rip the bandage off and get rid of the 2 mcollective related modules. This will have some unfortunate consequences for users wrt having to change their deployment and Hiera data but ultimately will be for the best for everyone. This is the first time we'll do a breaking change to users Puppet code really since the inception of this project, we'll be careful and hope to do it right, so we can give you another few years of stability after.

Todays releases starts this process by making a number of big changes. These will not yet require major changes to your processes - except maybe two items - but will set us up to achieve the goal of getting rid of the overlapping modules with competing configuration approaches.

 * MCollective plugins, DDLs etc are stored in `/opts/puppetlabs/mcollective/plugins/mcollective`. **As of this release files not managed by Puppet in this directory will be purged (after being filebucketed)**. This will help us prepare to move them to their own directory in the next release. If you place files there out of Puppet I suggest you [package them into modules](https://choria.io/docs/development/mcorpc/packaging/).
 * Configuration is moved from `/etc/puppetlabs/mcollective` to `/etc/choria`. We will try to purge from the old location, but you might have some left over there that can be removed
 * 50+ files from the `mcollective_choria` module was moved into the Gem, these will be purged from the libdir. `choria-mcorpc-support` version `2.23.1` will the lowest version we support.
 * With an eye to retiring the `mcollective_agent_bolt_tasks` module we moved the `mcollective_agent_bolt_tasks::ping` task to `choria::ping`

We have a number of `mco <command>` commands that are considered Core to MCollective - `inventory`, `choria_util`, `rpc` and more - we have reimplemented a number of these in the Go binary and in an effort to minimise the number of overlapping implementations some changes are being made here:

 * `mco rpc` will now automatically invoke `choria req` (aka `choria rpc`)
 * `mco inventory` will now automatically invoke `choria inventory`
 * We created a `mco find` equivalent in choria called `choria discover` (aka `choria find`) but not redirected this as it's an important debugging tool pf the core behaviors.
 * `mco choria_util request_cert` will error and instruct you to use `choria enroll` instead
 * The Go system got a PuppetDB discovery system and will honor the configuration of default discovery method, the `--dm` flag was added a few places to allow you to choose as before. 
 
Today these redirections are silent, in a new release they will also log warnings.

This means in order to use these `mco` commands you will now need the `choria` binary on your system. We made this easier by supporting setting `choria::server: false` in hiera and hope to release a Homebrew tap for OS X users to make the `choria` binary available there.

## Upcoming changes

In our next module releases the `choria` module will receive opt-in abilities to manage client configuration and the client management in the `mcollective` will support opt-out. This will let you migrate your configuration over at a time that's convenient.  After that we will remove the ability for the `mcollective` module to package these, which will then make it redundant.

The remaining features delivered by the `mcollective_choria` module will be accessed by the Gem, but we need some improvements in the Go daemon side.

We will produce a followup post that guides you in migrating from old Hiera values to the newer approach at the next release.

## Release Details

## [Choria Server version 0.19.0](https://github.com/choria-io/go-choria)

Links: [Changes](https://github.com/choria-io/go-choria/compare/v0.18.0...v0.19.0), [Release](https://github.com/choria-io/go-choria/releases/tag/v0.19.0)

### Overview

There is a number of really significant improvements to the Choria Server in this release, most significantly we support `-S` compound filters again but using a new language that's easy to extend and maintain.

We've adopted the [expr](https://github.com/antonmedv/expr) based Expression Language to build a new filtering system, this is in use in 2 places:

 * When performing requests using the `rpc` application the results can be filtered on the client side using an expression. See [Filtering results ](/docs/concepts/cli/#filtering-results)
 * When discovering nodes the compound filters can be used to perform complex matching against remote nodes. In a future release we'll support data plugins. See [Complex Compound or Select Queries](/docs/concepts/cli/#complex-compound-or-select-queries).

Both of these features are experimental and will only be 100% solid once Data plugins are supported. For now I'd be very keen on any feedback you might have.
