We're pleased to announce the next set of Choria releases, these are mainly bug fixes, but we have a few important changes
to the Choria Server and Broker.

We have a new Registration plugin that will send all the data needed for discovery, previous supported plugin only read
a specific file regularly, the new plugin will send all the active state - facts, classes, collectives and more. This is
a first step towards building our own discovery database to replace our use of PuppetDB in the long run.

To configure the `inventory_content` registration plugin you can set:

```yaml
choria::server_config:
  registration: inventory_content
  plugin.choria.registration.inventory_content.target: mcollective.ingest.discovery.%{facts.fqdn}
  plugin.choria.registration.inventory_content.compression: true
```

Replacing `mcollective.ingest.discovery.%{facts.fqdn}` with your subject of choice. The intention is to ingest this into
our Streaming server - more detail below.

The Choria Broker is starting to use the NATS Account system to create isolation between different organisational units,
today we move all clients and nodes into a `choria` account as a first step.  If you are upgrading a cluster of Choria
Brokers expect to see some errors related to this account being unknown.  Once your entire cluster is upgraded it will
resolve. There might be some short network splits during this time.

Additionally, we now enable a new `system` account that will have events published in it for:

 * connects and disconnects
 * authentication errors
 * server shutdowns
 * regular server states

There are also a number of broker system level APIs for building reports and more. See the full post for details.

We're starting to expose a [NATS JetStream](https://docs.nats.io/jetstream/) based Streaming system, which we'll call
Choria Streaming, to ingest registration, scout status, system events and more for downstream processing and analysis.

This is a huge topic, one that we're still working on for Choria framing so more details on that later, this release
adds a number of configuration items related to that already.

The Puppet modules are now able to configure something called Leaf Nodes to facilitate access to Choria from remote offices
and, especially, high latency destinations.  A blog post will be published this week covering that.

Special thanks to Romain Tarti√®re, Trey Dockendorf, Tim Meusel and Mark Frost for their contributions in this release.

To access the system services configure a user like this, you'll still need to access the broker with the usual certs
and so forth, this is an identity to gain access just to the Choria Broker internals:

```yaml
choria::broker::system_user: system
choria::broker::system_password: secret
```

Once enabled the [natscli](https://github.com/nats-io/natscli) can be used to access the state of your network, here 
are some examples.

A login event:

```nohighlight
% nats event --context system.ams
Listening for Client Connection events on $SYS.ACCOUNT.*.CONNECT
Listening for Client Disconnection events on $SYS.ACCOUNT.*.DISCONNECT
Listening for Authentication Errors events on $SYS.SERVER.*.CLIENT.AUTH.ERR
