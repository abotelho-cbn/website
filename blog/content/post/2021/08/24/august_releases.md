This is the first release since April, and it's a massive release bringing many enhancements and new features.

We are introducing [Choria Streams](https://choria.io/docs/streams/) - a Stream Processing framework built into the Choria Broker
powered by [NATS JetStream](https://docs.nats.io/jetstream). I wrote a blog post about this [Introducing Choria Streams](https://choria.io/blog/post/2021/08/05/choria_streams/) that's worth a read.

Additionally, we added [Choria Key-Value Store](https://choria.io/docs/streams/key-value/), [Choria Governor](https://choria.io/docs/streams/governor/) and
[Choria Message Submit](https://choria.io/docs/streams/governor/) all powered by Choria Streams and each in their own right a big feature.

Other major enhancements are that we now support Websockets for the network connections between Servers, Broker and Go clients.

Autonomous Agents now have a data layer meaning within an Autonomous Agent data can be fetched from stores like other Key-Value 
stores and this data can be accessed by Watchers at run time. We expose node facts to Autonomous Agents in the data layer. 
Additionally, we support watching Choria Key-Value Store for changes which updates the data layer and trigger transitions. 
Exec Watchers also support Governors to create orchestration-free rolling upgrades etc.

We made huge improvements to Provisioning, we blogged about this in [Provisioning HA and Security](https://choria.io/blog/post/2021/08/13/secure_and_ha_provisioning/).
There you can also see we support Leader Election against Choria Streams as a library feature.

On the documentation front we added a big section about [Choria Streams](https://choria.io/docs/streams/) but also received permission to Open Source
some documentation that shows how a very large - millions of nodes - Choria deployment might look. This is a proven design in active use in production 
for a few years already.  We are busy building another such network at the moment, and a lot of the enhancements in Provisioning is as a result of 
this work.  Find the document at [Large Scale Design](https://choria.io/docs/concepts/large_scale/).
