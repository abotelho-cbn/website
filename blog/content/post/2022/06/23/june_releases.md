It's time for our next release and this one is packed full of goodies after quite a long development period.
While our previous release was more about internal plumbing this one brings exciting user visible quality of
life improvements and significant new features.

## App Builder

We recently introduced [App Builder](https://choria.io/blog/post/2022/05/25/app_builder/), a operations tool
for building custom CLI commands that wrap many tools into one single app.

In Choria we extend the App Builder to have the ability to interact with Key-Value Stores, initiate RPC requests
and perform discovery.

To use this simply change your app symlink from `appbuilder` to `choria`.

See the [App Builder Documentation](https://choria-io.github.io/appbuilder/) for full reference of the extensions Choria adds.

## `choria` Command UX

We forked the Kingpin CLI parser into a Choria project called [Fisk](https://github.com/choria-io/fisk) that
extends Kingpin in various ways and introduce some breaking changes. We now use Fisk in all our tools.

As part of moving to Fisk the help output from `choria` has been changed significantly to be shorter and easier
to navigate with less superfluous information on every page.

We also add a new `cheat` feature to the CLI that gives you access to cheat sheet style help, here's an example:

```nohighlight
$ choria cheat req
# further documentation https://choria.io/docs/concepts/cli/

# request the status of a service
choria req service status service=httpd

...
```

Run `choria cheat` for a list of available cheats, contributions to these would be greatly appreciated!

## Improved Testing

We now have full integration testing where real running clusters are built and real network round trips are
tested, this is a significant step forward in achieving reliability in the long run.

We also now do daily tests of installing Choria using Puppet on every support Linux Distro.

## Operating Systems

We now publish packages for EL9 and Ubuntu 22.04. Debian packages are tagged by their distribution name to help with mirroring.

We removed Ubuntu Xenial, Debian Stretch and EL6.

## Contributors

Special thanks to Jonathan Matthews, Vincent Janelle, Nicolas Le Gaillart, Lena Schneider  and Romain Tarti√®re for their contributions.
